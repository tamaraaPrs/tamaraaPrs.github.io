        <p>
          Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering in a joint program between McGill University and Université Paris Cité. 
          I am co-supervised by <a href="https://www.ajungmoon.com/">AJung Moon</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/">Jin Guo</a>, <a href="https://geoffroycouteau.github.io/">Geoffroy Couteau</a> and <a href="https://tumbolandia.net/">Michele Orrù</a>.
          My PhD research focuses primarily on AI governance and is supported by the OBVIA scholarship program.
          I particularly enjoy conducting interdisciplinary research at the intersection of Cryptography, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Ethics, and Governance.
        </p><p>
          I also organize the <a href="mila-govAI-RG.html">AI Governance Reading Group</a> and the Responsible AI Lunch at MILA with Veronica Xia :)

      <h2>Research Interests</h2>
      <p>
        Although I am generally interested in all topics related to AI governance, there are two subjects that I focus on in particular:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>AI Verifiability:</strong> 
            This still-emerging field encompasses efforts to verify certain claims about an AI system, such as compliance with specific safety or ethical standards, while minimizing the amount of trust required for this verification. 
            I am particularly interested in the use of cryptographic techniques to achieve this goal.
            This topic is the main focus of my PhD research.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Openness in AI:</strong> Openness in AI was the topic of my Master’s thesis and all my currently published papers. I am still interested in this topic during my PhD, even though it is not the main focus of my doctoral research.
