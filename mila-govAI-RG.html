    <h1>AI Governance Reading Group</h1>
    <section id="about">
        <p>Welcome to the MILA's AI Governance Reading Group: a bi-weekly meeting to discuss AI Governance topics with researchers and students from diverse backgrounds! Each week, we alternate between <strong><em>discussion-based sessions</em></strong> (we choose a topic and a paper related to that topic, and invite everyone to read the article and come and discuss the topic) and <strong><em>speaker-based sessions</em></strong> (a speaker will come and present their research). <strong>Everyone is encouraged to join the discussion, even if you don't know much about the topic!</strong></p>
        <p>If you have any questions please reach out to Tamara Paris (<a href="mailto:tamara.paris@mail.mcgill.ca">tamara.paris@mail.mcgill.ca</a>) or Veronica Xia (<a href="mailto:veronica.xia@mila.quebec">veronica.xia@mila.quebec</a>).</p>
